    <h2>EMPLOYMENT</h2>
    <h3>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2016 - 2021, Consulting MTS </h3>
    <h4>Virtual Machine Service</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led the OCI VM offering definition, design &amp; implementation for <a
          href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">OCI</a>.
        Delivered with block storage and virtual network integration (via both VIF and virtio) in ~4 months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Defined product requirements and implemented proof of concept for Bring Your Own Image (<a
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm">BYOI</a>) support
        for VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU and other virtualization products.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Strictly serializable database for control planes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed novel (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210342311A1">patent 20210342311</a>) optimistic
        concurrency primitives (e.g. opaque test-and-increment counters) to prevent hot key contention from aborting
        transaction commits. Proof of concept implementation &amp; evaluation of new backend storage for improved
        scaling and availability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborated on design, implementation and deployment of transition to cell architecture to mitigate noisy
        neighbors and limit operational blast radius. Advised and collaborated with client teams on effective adoption
        and schema for varied use cases from standard micro-service backend to source of truth for metadata distributed
        data planes at scale.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Services 2005 - 2014, Senior SDE</h3>
    <h4>Amazon Aurora distributed storage </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented Aurora's zero-copy, vectored IO custom RPC and network messaging that achieved the
        ambitious latency &amp; throughput goals for fanning out log writes from the database engine to distributed
        storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentored remote Bay Area team through integration of database engine with distributed storage via custom RPC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identified numerous performance bottlenecks in the networking and storage I/O paths via profiling, and
        implemented solutions:
        e.g.
        task scheduler per core to minimize task queue lock contention,
        eliminating heap allocations on copy of C++ function object callbacks for IO/event completions,
        and message buffer vectors to avoid copying user data payloads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Virtual Private Cloud</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led design and implementation the VPC virtual network management control plane.
        The system manages VPC customers' network metadata, including network topology maps to physical resources,
        metadata ACLs, and provides a stream source for distribution to hypervisors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborated with AWS Linux kernel team on successful effort to improve packet throughput on hypervisors.
        Achieved by moving source identification logic from control plane agent in user space, to a kernel module.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extended and maintained the distributed firewall system that implements EC2 instance security groups across
        all the hypervisors in a data center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimized in-memory representation of VPC network topology and security policy on hypervisors to support massive
        VPC &amp; EC2 scaling while making efficient use of limited dom0 hypervisor memory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>EC2 from founding, through beta and GA</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented the EC2 control plane hypervisor agent. Ran on > 100K physical hosts (and now > 1M
        hypervisors) to manage the customer virtual machine (EC2 instance) lifecycle. Extended the agent to collaborate
        with neighboring hypervisors to download and cache boot images from object store service (<a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"></a>S3</a>). The improvement allowed fast EC2 instance launches despite
        limited edge bandwidth (circa private beta launch).
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented many internal and public utilities, micro-services and tools for EC2:
        e.g. command-line AMI packager and up-loader,
        internal dynamic DNS vendor for EC2 instances and hypervisors,
        and network rate limiting at hypervisor to prevent noisy neighbor problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Helped grow the EC2 team in Seattle by ramping up new team members tasked with developing new EC2 networking and
        security functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>
