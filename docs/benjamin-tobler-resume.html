    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a software engineer working in distributed systems, networking & virtualization.
      My start in cloud was at AWS on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>.
      I developed and owned the control plane hypervisor agent from scratch to GA.
      Work at EC2 expanded to the conception of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">VPC</a>.
      I took ownership of the development & delivery of VPC's control plane, user & internal APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After VPC GA I joined the nascent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a> project.
      I developed the storage RPC stack, IO and task scheduling.
      Later I delivered <a href="">Virtual Machines</a> for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
      At OCI I designed & patented novel operations for OCC based database systems.
      These server managed operations elinated a significant & common class commit conflicts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently I've been working in B2B on an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange">EDI</a> platform.
      In the past I've worked in EFT implementing transaction processing platforms.
      I implemented 10K connection support for Java (before non-blocking IO support in the JDK).
      Additionally I implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> support and HSM vendor independent cryptographic libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>EMPLOYMENT</h2>
    <h3>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</h3>
    <i>2016 - 2021, Consulting MTS</i>

    <h4><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines/">Virtual Machines</a></h4>

    <p>
      Owned development Virtual Machine service and delivered within aggressive TTM goal.<br />
      Co-ordinated developement & integration across block storage, virtual networking and compute teams.<br />
      Designed control plane architecture involving command distribution and state collation from VM hosts. <br />
      Responsible for operational readiness at GA.<br />
      Fast followed GA with competitor beating bulk provisioning for Gartner evaluation.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Responsible for post GA roadmap, including BYOI support.<br />
      Owned delivery incremental customer post GA features & system functionality.<br />
      Including capacity management automation, improved operational insights &amp; troubleshooting tooling. <br />
      Defined requirements for <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm">Bring Your Own
        Image</a> to enabled lift & shift of existing VMWare, VirtualBox, etc customer VMs.
      Implemented BYOI PoC integration of key technologies and planned development tasks and schedule.
    </p>

    <h4>Control Plane DB Service</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Worked with team to transition from a ORM style database library layer, to database as a service, including cell
        based
        architecture to limit blast radius and mitigate noisy neighbours. Worked with client teams on migration and
        effective
        use of the service for regional replication, fan out to data plane nodes and data integration use cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed novel (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210342311A1">patent 20210342311</a>) optimistic
        concurrency primitives (e.g. opaque test-and-increment counters) to eliminate transaction aborts caused by
        hot key contention under common workload patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed (in conjunction with TLA verification) and implemented proof of concept for
        new scalable transactional storage for future scaling and high availability.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Services 2005 - 2014, Senior SDE</h3>
    <h4>Amazon Aurora distributed storage </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Developed task and IO scheduling core (including zero-copy, vectored IO custom RPC) to provide a platform for
        the team to develop features that met the ambitious latency and throughput requirements of the storage system.
        E.g. enabled highly concurrent and low latency messaging for the database engine to massively fan out (striped)
        writes to distributed storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentored remote Bay Area team through integration of database engine with distributed storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designing to avoid (and profiled to identify) performance bottlenecks on the fast path. E.g. eliding locks and
        using suitable data structures and concurrency mechanisms for the M:N threading and partitioning model;
        Eliminating heap allocations by implementing custom C++ function objects for callbacks and completions; Custom
        message buffer vectors to separate user data payloads from headers without copying. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Virtual Private Cloud</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led design and implementation the VPC virtual network management control plane.
        The system manages VPC customers' network metadata, including network topology maps to physical resources,
        metadata ACLs, and provides a stream source for distribution to hypervisors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborated with AWS Linux kernel team on successful effort to improve packet throughput on hypervisors.
        Achieved by moving source identification logic from control plane agent in user space, to a kernel module.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extended and maintained the distributed firewall system that implements EC2 instance security groups across
        all the hypervisors in a data center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimized in-memory representation of VPC network topology and security policy on hypervisors to support massive
        VPC &amp; EC2 scaling while making efficient use of limited dom0 hypervisor memory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>EC2 from founding, through beta and GA</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented the EC2 control plane hypervisor agent. Ran on > 100K physical hosts (and now > 1M
        hypervisors) to manage the customer virtual machine (EC2 instance) lifecycle. Extended the agent to collaborate
        with neighboring hypervisors to download and cache boot images from object store service (<a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"></a>S3</a>). The improvement allowed fast EC2 instance launches despite
        limited edge bandwidth (circa private beta launch).
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented many internal and public utilities, micro-services and tools for EC2:
        e.g. command-line AMI packager and up-loader,
        internal dynamic DNS vendor for EC2 instances and hypervisors,
        and network rate limiting at hypervisor to prevent noisy neighbor problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Helped grow the EC2 team in Seattle by ramping up new team members tasked with developing new EC2 networking and
        security functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>
