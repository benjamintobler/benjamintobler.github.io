    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a software engineer working in distributed systems, networking &amp;
      virtualization.

      My start in cloud was at AWS building <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>.

      I developed and owned the control plane hypervisor agent &amp; VM resource
      manager from inception to GA.

      When EC2 expanded to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">VPC</a> I owned
      development &amp; delivery of VPC's control plane and APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After VPC GA, I joined the nascent <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a> project
      where I developed the storage RPC stack, IO and task scheduling and
      coordinated DB engine storage client development between Palo Alto and
      Seattle teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud</a> I owned the
      delivery of <a
        href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines/">Virtual
        Machines</a>, coordinating development and integration across
      networking, storage and compute teams.

      Later I designed &amp; patented novel transactor executed &amp; arbitrated
      guarded operations for OCC based database systems.

      The innovation eliminated a common class of commit conflicts causing
      performance &amp; availability issues across some of the largest OCI
      control planes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently I've been working in B2B on an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange">EDI</a>
      platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past I've worked in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_funds_transfer">EFT </a>
      implementing transaction processing
      platforms.

      I implemented 10K connection support for Java (prior to non-blocking IO
      availability in the JDK) enabling customers to support thousands of
      POS terminals and ATMs with a single transaction processor.

      Additionally I implemented <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> support and a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">HSM</a>
      vendor independent cryptographic library.

    <h2>WORK</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud</a></h3>
    <i>2016 - 2021, Consulting MTS</i>

    <h4><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines/">Virtual
        Machines</a></h4>

    <p>
      Owned development of Virtual Machine service and delivered meeting an
      aggressive TTM goal.

      Coordinated development &amp; integration across block storage, virtual
      networking and compute teams.

      Designed control plane architecture involving command distribution and
      state collation from VM hosts.

      Responsible for operational readiness at GA.

      Fast followed GA with competitor beating bulk provisioning for Gartner
      evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Responsible for post GA roadmap, including BYOI support.

      Owned delivery incremental customer post GA features &amp; system
      functionality.

      Including capacity management automation, improved operational
      insights
      &amp; troubleshooting tooling.

      Defined requirements for
      <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm">Bring
        Your Own Image
      </a>
      to enable lift &amp; shift of users' VMWare (etc) VMs to OCI.

      Implemented BYOI PoC integration of key technologies and planned
      development tasks and schedule.
    </p>

    <h4>Control Plane DB Service</h4>

    <p>
      Transitioned the internal database system used by OCI control planes
      from ORM style database library layer to a service using a cell
      architecture for tenant isolation to limit blast radius and mitigate
      noisy neighbours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Designed <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210342311A1">novel
      </a> transactor executed &amp; arbitrated guarded operations.

      Eliminated transaction aborts caused by hot key contention under common
      workload patterns of the largest control planes in the org.

      The innovation means that concurrent transactions are no longer
      necessarily aborted due to conflicts on, for example, incrementing quota
      counters or allocation of resources from a set. Instead these operations
      are arbitrated and completed at commit time by the transactor.
    </p>

    <p>
      PoC'd a new KV store leveraging existing distributed systems components
      and collaborated to use formal methods (TLA+) to verify strict
      serializability.
    </p>

    <h4>Dev Tools</h4>

    <p>
      Led work to extend the org's microservice generator by developing a
      service framework SDK for the output to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Significantly reduced: Effort teams spend on undifferentiated
      functionality, boilerplate &amp; being operationally ready; Opportunity
      for bugs; Operational load.
    </p>

    <p>
      Determined actual needs by collaboration and source code repository
      auditing.

      Identified common pitfalls, relevant best practices and conventions for
      APIs, data access, configuration and resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Delivered: Resource GC - e.g. idempotency tokens & operation identifiers
      and tombstoning; Resiliency mechanisms - e.g. PID based load shedder &
      circuit breaker; API functionality - e.g. operation idempotency
      management.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a></h3>
    <i>2005 - 2014, Senior SDE</i>

    <h4><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a></h4>

    <p>
      Developed high performance storage RPC stack, IO and task scheduling.

      Implemented and used zero copy, user mode task scheduling, vectored
      non-blocking IO with resource partitioning and core assignment to achieve
      low latency, high concurrency log write request processing.

      Profiled and optimized hot path to achieve close to line rate RPC
      capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coordinated DB engine storage client development and integration across
      Palo Alto and Seattle based teams.

      Owned security threat model analysis and mitigations.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Virtual Private Cloud</a></h4>

    <p>
      Owned development and delivery of the control plane frontend, user facing
      and internal APIs.

      The control plane processes API calls, from users and internal compute
      services, to modify virtual network topology, VM attachments, external
      routing and security ACLs. The API requests are converted into commands
      that it reliably delivers to 100,000s of hypervisors hosts and network
      &amp; edge devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collaborated with AWS Linux kernel team on successful effort to improve
      packet throughput on hypervisors.

      Achieved by moving source identification logic from control plane agent in
      user space, to a kernel module.
    </p>

    <p>
      Extended and maintained the distributed firewall system that implements
      EC2 instance security groups across all the hypervisors in a data center.
    </p>

    <p>
      Optimized in-memory representation of VPC network topology and security
      policy on hypervisors to support massive VPC &amp; EC2 scaling while
      making efficient use of limited hypervisor host memory.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a></h4>

    <p>
      Developed &amp; and owned the EC2 control plane hypervisor agent & VM
      resources coordinator from conception through GA.

      The agent manages the VM lifecycle on each of the many thousands (now
      millions) of hypervisor hosts.

      Implemented collaborative peer boot image download when original pre-GA
      object storage read capacity was highly limited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implemented internal and public tooling and microservices, including AMI
      packager and up-loader CLI, dynamic DNS vendor and intra data center
      network rate limiting to mitigate noisy neighbours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Helped grow the EC2 team in Seattle by ramping up new team members tasked
      with developing new EC2 networking and security functionality.
