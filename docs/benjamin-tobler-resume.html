    <h2>EMPLOYMENT</h2>
    <h3>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2016 - 2021, Consulting MTS </h3>
    <h4>Virtual Machine Service</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led the OCI VM offering definition, design &amp; implementation for <a
          href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">OCI</a>.
        Delivered with block storage and virtual network integration (via both VIF and virtio) in ~4 months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identified requirements and implemented proof of concepts for Bring Your Own Image (<a
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm">BYOI</a>) support
        for
        VMWare, Qemu, VirtualBox and other virtualization products.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Strictly serializable database for control planes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed novel optimistic concurrency primitive (opaque, serializable counters) to solve hot key contention
        problem
      </li>
      <li>
        Helped team transition to cell architecture to isolate tenants to mitigate noisy neighbours and blast radius
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Services 2005 - 2014, Senior SDE</h3>
    <h4>Amazon Aurora distributed storage </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented of a Aurora's zero-copy, vectored IO custom RPC to achieve stringent latency,
        throughput and
        scaling goals for the data plane.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentored remote Bay Area team through integration of database engine with distributed storage via custom RPC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identified numerous performance bottlenecks in the networking and storage I/O paths via profiling, and
        implemented solutions:
        e.g.
        task scheduler per core to minimize task queue lock contention,
        eliminating heap allocations on copy of C++ function object callbacks for IO/event completions,
        and message buffer vectors to avoid copying user data payloads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Virtual Private Cloud</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led design and implementation the VPC virtual network management control plane.
        The system manages VPC customers' network metadata, including network topology maps to physical resources,
        metadata ACLs, and provides a stream source for distribution to hypervisors.
        topology and state of large numbers of virtual networks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborated with AWS Linux kernel team on successful effort to improve packet throughput on hypervisors.
        Achieved by moving control plane connection source identification functionality from hypervisor control plane
        agent in user space, into a custom kernel module.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extended and maintained the distributed firewall system that implemented user specified security groups and
        policies applied to their EC2 instances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimized in-memory representation of VPC network topology and security policy on hypervisors to support massive
        VPC &amp; EC2 scaling while making efficient use of limited dom0 hypervisor memory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>EC2 from founding, through beta and GA</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented the EC2 control plane hypervisor agent. Ran on > 100k physical hosts (and now > 1MM
        hypervisors) to manage the customer virtual machine (EC2 instance) lifecycle. Extended the agent to collaborate
        with neighbouring hypervisors to download and cache boot images from object store service (<a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"></a>S3</a>). The improvement allowed fast EC2 instance launches despite
        limited edge bandwidth (circa private beta launch).
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented many internal and public utilities, micro-services and tools for EC2:
        e.g. command-line AMI packager and uploader,
        internal dynamic DNS vendor for EC2 instances and hypervisors,
        and network rate limiting at hypervisor to prevent noisy neigbour problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Helped grow the EC2 team in Seattle by ramping up new team members brought in to on EC2 networking and security.
        and engineers. </li>
    </ul>
