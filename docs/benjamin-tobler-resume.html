    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a software engineer working in distributed systems, networking &amp;
      virtualization.

      My start in cloud was at AWS building <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>.

      I developed and owned the control plane hypervisor agent &amp; VM resource
      manager from inception to GA.

      When EC2 expanded to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">VPC</a> I owned
      development &amp; delivery of VPC's control plane and APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After VPC GA, I joined the nascent <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a> project
      where I developed the storage RPC stack, IO and task scheduling and
      coordinated DB engine storage client development between Palo Alto and
      Seattle teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud</a> I owned the
      delivery of <a
        href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines/">Virtual
        Machines</a>, coordinating development and integration across
      networking, storage and compute teams.

      Later I designed &amp; patented novel server arbitrated operations for OCC
      based database systems.

      The innovation eliminated common class commit conflicts that could cause
      performance &amp; availability issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently I've been working in B2B on an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange">EDI</a>
      platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past I've worked in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_funds_transfer">EFT </a>
      implementing transaction processing
      platforms.

      I implemented 10K connection support for Java (before non-blocking IO
      support in the JDK) enabling customers to support entire fleets of POS
      and
      ATMs with a single transaction system.

      Additionally I implemented <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> support and a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">HSM</a>
      vendor independent cryptographic library.

    <h2>WORK</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud</a></h3>
    <i>2016 - 2021, Consulting MTS</i>

    <h4><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines/">Virtual
        Machines</a></h4>

    <p>
      Owned development Virtual Machine service and delivered within aggressive
      TTM goal.

      Coordinated development &amp; integration across block storage, virtual
      networking and compute teams.

      Designed control plane architecture involving command distribution and
      state collation from VM hosts.

      Responsible for operational readiness at GA.

      Fast followed GA with competitor beating bulk provisioning for Gartner
      evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Responsible for post GA roadmap, including BYOI support.

      Owned delivery incremental customer post GA features &amp; system
      functionality.

      Including capacity management automation, improved operational insights
      &amp; troubleshooting tooling.

      Defined requirements for <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm">Bring
        Your Own
        Image</a> to enable lift &amp; shift of users' VMWare (etc) VMs to OCI.
      Implemented BYOI PoC integration of key technologies and planned
      development tasks and schedule.
    </p>

    <h4>Control Plane DB Service</h4>

    <p>
      Transitioned the internal database system used by OCI control planes
      from ORM style database library layer to a service using a cell
      architecture for tenant isolation to limit blast radius and mitigate
      noisy neighbours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developed <a
        href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210342311A1">novel
      </a> transactor arbitrated operations.

      These commit time operations eliminate transaction aborts caused by hot
      key contention under common workload patterns.

      The innovation means that concurrent transactions that would have aborted
      due to conflicts on, for example, incrementing quota counters or
      allocating from a pool of resources, can have these operations arbitrated
      and completed at commit time by the transactor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developed and PoC'd new DB for use leveraging existing distributed systems
      components and formal methods (TLA+) to verification strictly
      serializability properties.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a></h3>
    <i>2005 - 2014, Senior SDE</i>

    <h4><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a></h4>

    <p>
      Developed high performance storage RPC stack, IO and task scheduling.

      Implemented and used zero copy, M:N user mode task scheduling,
      scatter-gather IO and resource partitioning and core assignment to achieve
      low latency, high concurrency log write request processing.

      Coordinated DB engine client developed and integrate against storage
      between Palo Alto and Seattle based teams.

      Profiled and optimized hot path to achieve close to line rate RPC
      capability.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Virtual Private Cloud</a></h4>

    <p>
      Owned development and delivery of the control plane frontend, user facing
      and internal APIs.

      The control plane processes API calls, from users and internal compute
      services, to modify virtual network topology, VM attachments, external
      routing and security ACLs. The API requests are converted into commands
      that it reliably delivers to 100,000s of hypervisors hosts and network
      &amp;
      edge devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collaborated with AWS Linux kernel team on successful effort to improve
      packet throughput on hypervisors.

      Achieved by moving source identification logic from control plane agent
      in user space, to a kernel module.
    </p>

    <p>
      Extended and maintained the distributed firewall system that implements
      EC2 instance security groups across all the hypervisors in a data center.
    </p>

    <p>
      Optimized in-memory representation of VPC network topology and security
      policy on hypervisors to support massive VPC &amp; EC2 scaling while
      making efficient use of limited dom0
      hypervisor memory.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a></h4>

    <p>
      Developed &amp; and owned the EC2 control plane hypervisor agent & VM
      resources coordinator from conception through GA.

      The agent manages the VM lifecycle on each of the many thousands (now
      millions) of hypervisor hosts.

      Implemented collaborative peer boot image download when original pre-GA
      object storage read capacity was highly limited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implemented internal and public tooling and microservices, including AMI
      packager and up-loader CLI, dynamic DNS vendor and intra data center
      network rate limiting to mitigate noisy neighbours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Helped grow the EC2 team in Seattle by ramping up new team members tasked
      with developing new EC2 networking and security functionality.
